# etcd-backup-on-ocp4
This repo has a playbook to assist with manually performing an etcd backup when the etcd-backup-operator does not work. 
There is a manaual step required before running the playbook in this reposiroty.
The process depends on oc debug command which is an interactive command and that part has to be performed before running the playbook here.
